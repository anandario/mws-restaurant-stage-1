#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

 :iphone: For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

:clipboard: You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It‚Äôs barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn‚Äôt include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn‚Äôt work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.


### What do I do from here?

:page_with_curl: Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

:memo: Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

:globe_with_meridians: This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

### Note about ES6

‚úèÔ∏è Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
